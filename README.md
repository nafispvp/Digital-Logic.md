# Digital Logic
# Introduction
👨‍💼Lecturer : Dr Farkhana binti Muchtar <br>
👨🏻‍🎓Section : 08

# 📝Summary
Digital Logic is a core subject in Computer Science that focuses on the fundamental principles of digital systems and how computers process information using binary values. In this course, I learned about number systems (binary, octal, and hexadecimal), Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, truth tables, Karnaugh maps, flip-flops, counters, and registers.

# 🪞Reflection
This subject helped me strengthen my analytical and logical reasoning skills. It also allowed me to better understand how software is closely connected to hardware, making me appreciate how instructions are processed at the lowest level. Digital Logic has prepared me for advanced subjects such as Computer Organization, Microprocessors, and Embedded Systems, and it has broadened my perspective as a Computer Science student.
